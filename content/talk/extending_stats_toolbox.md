title: "Extending the Statistical Toolbox @ BSI PhD-Day 2019"
subtitle: "P-values, Bayes Factors and Beyond"
summary: "What we often forget when making use of statistics
in our daily research practice is that statistics itself is a rapidly
developing research field that is rapidly progressing. For
instance, in recent yearsBayesFactors have been proposed asan
alternative to p-values and their adaptation has quickly
increased in psychological papers in recent years with many
scholars claiming that they should become the standard way of
statistical inference. However, while people start to adopt Bayes
Factors quickly, there are problems and challenges that they
might often go unnoticed. Furthermore, many Bayesian
statisticians themselves say that we should not use p-values and
BayesFactorsand suggest yet other alternatives."
