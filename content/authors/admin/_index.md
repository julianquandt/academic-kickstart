My name is Julian Quandt. I'm a PhD student at the [Behavioural Science Institute](https://www.ru.nl/bsi/) at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) in Nijmegen (the one in the Netherlands, not the USA one). My supervisors are [Harm Veling](.), [Rob Holland](.), and [Bernd Figner](.).

In my PhD project, I aim to increase our understanding of food-choices (and value-based decisions in gerneral).
Specifically, I want to investigate how values of real-world objects (such as your favorite chocolate-cookies) are represented and retrieved on a cognive level.
The questions that keep me awake at night are:

- How do people retrieve value-information when they make a decision?
- Why are some preferences stable, while other preferences tend to fluctuate?
- Why are people confident about some choices while they are uncertain of others?

My idea is that values should be understood as distributions, that represent previous experiences with an object. When making a choice, people sample from these distributions.
While this idea is not new (see eg. [here](.),[here](.), or [here](.)) I think that these distributions might be deeply related to the questions above.
This is, when distributions are wider (e.g. when experiences are very ambiguous regarding the quality of a food-snack), people will express this as uncertainty.
Thus, to improve my nightrest, I want to explore these questions by developing empirical measures of these distributions and relate them to behavioural measures of uncertainty.

If this was not too boring for you thus far and you are still reading, I am also an enthousiast of statistics, statistical modelling, programming (R and python in particular) open science, open access, open source and open bars.

Next to this, I really enjoy travelling, photography and whiskey-tastings.
