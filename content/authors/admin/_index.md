My name is Julian Quandt. I'm a PhD student at the [Behavioural Science Institute](https://www.ru.nl/bsi/) at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) in Nijmegen.
My supervisors are [Harm Veling](https://harmveling.wordpress.com/), [Rob Holland](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/holland-r/), and [Bernd Figner](http://decision-lab.org/).

In my PhD project, I aim to increase our understanding confidence in value-based decision-making.
The questions that keep me awake at night are:

- How do people retrieve value-information when they make a decision?
- How does this retrieval of information relate to people's confidence in their decisions? This is, what does high or low confidence in VBD reflect?
- Why are people confident about some choices while they are uncertain of others?

Building on the idea that values are retrieved by [sequential sampling from memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27253447), I want to see whether we can measure and predict confidence based on the clarity of the value-information that people retrieve from memory during evaluation of and decision between items.

Aside from working on my dissertation, I also enjoy working on my skills in statistics, statistical modelling and programming (R and python). Moreover, I am an enthusiast of open science, open access, open source and open bars.
