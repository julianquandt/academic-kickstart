Hi, I'm Julian. I'm a PhD student at the [Behavioural Science Institute](https://www.ru.nl/bsi/) at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) in Nijmegen, the Netherlands working with [Harm Veling](https://harmveling.wordpress.com/), [Rob Holland](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/holland-r/), and [Bernd Figner](http://decision-lab.org/).

In my PhD project, I aim to increase our understanding of confidence in value-based decisions.
Specifically, I am investigating how people's feeling of confidence in their decisions arises.
In other words, why are people very confident in some decisions (e.g. how much they like their favorite chocolate-cookie) but less so in other decisions (e.g. what dish they prefer in a restaurant).

Next to this, am also very much interested in statistics, statistical modelling, programming (R and python in particular) open science, open access, open source and open bars.

Next to this, I really enjoy travelling, photography and whiskey-tastings.

If you are also interested in any of these things and want to discuss or meet up, feel free to [mail](mailto:julian_quandt@live.de) or [tweet](https://twitter.com/julianquandt) or visit my [github](https://github.com/julianquandt) and [OSF](http://osf.io/4k6zs) page for more information about my work.
