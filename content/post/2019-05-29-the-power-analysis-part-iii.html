<h1>The Power Analysis by simulation in <code>R</code> for really any design - Part III</h1>
<p>This is Part III of my tutorial on how to do power-analysis by simulation.
In Part I, we saw how to do a simulation for a simple toy-example with a coin-toss.
In part II we learned how to simulate univariate and multivariate normal-distributions, specify our assmuptions about the expected effect and test our simulated data with different t-tests.
In this part, we will focus on how we can write a flexible test for any model by making use of the fact that many statistical standard methods (e.g.Â t-test, ANOVA) can be rewritten as a linear model.
This way, no matter what situation we find ourselves in, we will always be able to use the same power-simulation with only slight changes.</p>
<p>In part IV we will learn how to apply this technique to complicated designs such as linear mixed-effects models and generalized mixed-effects models.</p>

<p>Before I even start with this topic, I want to point out that I took much of the information I present here from Jonas Kristoffer Lindel</p>
